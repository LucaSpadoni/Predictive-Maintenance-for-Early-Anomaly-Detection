# 📊 predictive_maintenance 🛠️
<h2>This is a project as part of the Artificial Intelligence course of the degree in computer science for management at the university of bologna</h2>
<br>Specific analysis of the data collected by the sensors for the development of a Machine Learning application, which exploits the correlations discovered in the data set to provide a sufficiently valid and correct prediction regarding a probable failure of a machine.
<br>Dataset used: “AI4I Predictive Maintenance Dataset”
<br>Lnk: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/601/ai4i+2020+predictive+maintenance+dataset
<br>The version of the dataset we used can be found in this github repository under the name "predictive_mainteniance.csv".

<br><h3>🎯 Objectives:</h3>
1. Refinement and pre-processing of the dataset used, so as to keep the data useful for the purpose and discard everything else.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), i.e. an in-depth study of the dataset aimed at discovering its main characteristics and searching for possible patterns, using statistical analysis tools
3. Application of certain classification algorithms to see which one can do the job most accurately

<h3>Example of dataset samples after pre-processing </h3>

<h3>EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)</h3>
<br>the output shows the type of failure and its absolute frequency. A quick glance at the table below immediately shows that the number of failures detected is extremely low compared to the cases labelled 'No Failure'.
